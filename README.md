# Snake Editor Alpha

Snake Editor is a minimalistic Python code editor written 100% in Python programming language.

> Snake Editor was a very old project I've already written alongside @Kamasoo, but I lost the project files. So I decided to rewrite it.

The goal of Snake Editor is to be an fan-made alternative to the built-in IDLE with high customization capabilities. If you are new in Python or want to contribute this is also a good project for you.

> Snake Editor is also built to be an educational project. Not means to be used in production.

## Getting things running
For now, Snake Editor is in its early stages of development (currently in *alpha* 0.0.1) and there's no way to use it as an proper Python package. So you need to run it manually by the source code.

To be able to use Snake Editor, you need an instance of the Python interpreter version 3.9 or higher and `pip` installed.

- 1st step: Clone the source code from the repository.
    ```console
    $ git clone https://github.com/marc-dantas/snake_editor/
    ```
- 2nd step: Get into the repository's folder.
    ```console
    $ cd snake_editor
    ```
> **Note**: Snake Editor doesn't use any third-party Python packages or libraries. You just need a full installation of Python's standard library to be able to run Snake Editor. 
- 3rd step: Run the main script.
    ```console
    $ python src/main.py
    ```

These steps should make you through the process and make you run Snake Editor properly.
